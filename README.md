## Introduction
Welcome to my CHIP-8 virtual machine (VM) project! This repository is the result of my endeavor to learn and understand the inner workings of the CHIP-8 system. CHIP-8, historically used on microcomputers in the 1970s, offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of early computing and emulation.

## Project Overview
This project includes:
- A virtual machine/emulator for the CHIP-8 language.

## Learning Objectives
Through this project, I aimed to:
- Deepen my understanding of how virtual machines and emulators function.
- Explore the challenges of interpreting and executing CHIP-8 instructions.

## Technologies Used
- Rust
- SDL2

## Getting Started

## Running the VM
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sreedevk/chip8`
- Navigate to the directory: `cd chip8`
- Copy any Chip8 ROM into the repo's directory (https://github.com/kripod/chip8-roms)
- run:
```bash
cargo run -r roms/path/to/romfile
```
